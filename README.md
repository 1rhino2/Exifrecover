# Rhino EXIF Recovery Tool

A beautiful, dependency-free Python tool to recover and analyze all possible metadata from images—even if EXIF is wiped.

- 🔍 **Forensics & Privacy:** Reveals every clue left in your images: timestamps, hashes, JPEG comments, quantization tables, and more.
- 🛡️ **No Magic:** If EXIF is gone, only pseudo-metadata and file info can be shown. No tool can restore what is truly erased.
- 🚀 **Zero Dependencies:** Pure Python. No installs. Cross-platform.
- 👁️ **See What Remains:** Instantly audit what metadata is still in your files after "removal."

**Usage:**

1. Put this script in your image folder.
2. Run: `python exif_recovery_tool.py`
3. Select an image. See all possible metadata, before and after recovery.
